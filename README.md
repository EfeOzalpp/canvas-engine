## Overview

A constraint-based visualization engine built directly on the browser’s Canvas API.

The system uses normalized input (0–1) to procedurally control color, shape allocation, motion, and layout through structured rules rather than hardcoded states.

> Status: pre–v1  
> The engine is functional, but the normalized input layer, and graphic-making is still being refined and is not yet finalized.

If you’re interested in using or exploring the system, feel free to reach out.
